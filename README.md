In the previous tasks, you were introduced to Solana basics and Rust. The goal of this task is to connect these elements and work with Rust on Solana. You will become familiar with the basic structure of Solana programs and learn how programming on Solana is done.
Task details
In the previous task, we implemented a calculator, and now we will bring part of this implementation on-chain. The essential idea behind this on-chain program is to initialize a calculator account with the corresponding update authority. The update authority can change operands inside the calculator (X and Y) as well as change the update authority of the Calculator. Additionally, there are methods such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division that will perform overflow/underflow resilient operations and emit the result into the Solana logs. Finally, we will subscribe to the logs in our test suite to check the correctness of the results. Your task is to understand how the program works and implement all parts marked as TODO.
